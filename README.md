Examining all of the costs related to delivering food orders—from direct costs like delivery fees and packaging to indirect costs like customer discounts and restaurant commission fees—is part of the food delivery cost and profitability analysis process. The research attempts to shed light on how profitable the meal delivery service is per order by contrasting these expenses with the income (which is mostly from order values and commission fees).

The steps for doing the Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis task is as follows:

Collecting comprehensive data related to aspects of food delivery operations.
Cleaning the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.
Extracting relevant features keeping cost and profitability in notice.
Breaking down the costs associated with each order, including fixed costs (like packaging) and variable costs (like delivery fees and discounts).
Determining the revenue generated from each order, focusing on commission fees and the order value before discounts.
For each order, calculate the profit by subtracting the total costs from the revenue. Analyze the distribution of profitability across all orders to identify trends.
Based on the cost and profitability analysis, develop strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing profitability.
Using the simulated data for the financial impact of proposed changes, such as adjusting discount or commission rates.
